# Day-1 Getting Started

## ✅ What I did
- Set up **Kali Linux** VM for hacking practice.
- Set up **Metasploitable2** as a vulnerable target machine.
- Created a **TryHackMe account** (Free).

## 📝 Notes
- Kali Linux will be my attacker machine.  
- Metasploitable2 will be my victim machine.  
- TryHackMe will give me guided labs for practice.

## 🎯 Next Steps
- Learn OSI & TCP/IP models.  
- Start documenting networking basics in `networking/` folder.
