# OSI vs TCP/IP Models

## OSI Model (7 Layers)
1. Application  
2. Presentation  
3. Session  
4. Transport  
5. Network  
6. Data Link  
7. Physical  

## TCP/IP Model (4 Layers)
1. Application  
2. Transport  
3. Internet  
4. Network Access  

## Mapping OSI ↔ TCP/IP
- Application ↔ Application  
- Transport ↔ Transport  
- Network ↔ Internet  
- Data Link + Physical ↔ Network Access  

## Key Points
- OSI is conceptual; TCP/IP is practical and used in real networks.  
- Most protocols like HTTP, FTP, DNS, TCP, IP are based on TCP/IP.
